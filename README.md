# PiProjects
A repo used for storing a bunch of different projects designed to run on the Rasberry Pi

## LightShow
This project is designed to control 5 different lights lined up on a breadboard connected to 5 gpio pins on the Pi. In cycles through several sequences that each include their own flashing pattern. Customizations can be made to the speed and iterations of each sequence before moving to the next one, and will continue to flash the lights until the program is exited.
